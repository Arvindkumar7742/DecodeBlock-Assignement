# Admin Dashboard with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This Admin Dashboard project provides an interface for managing users and their activities. The dashboard includes role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to specific features depending on the user’s role (Admin or User). The application is built with React.js and features data visualization for user statistics, responsive design, and CRUD operations using a mock API.


## Features

#### User Interface

- A main dashboard overview panel displays key user statistics (e.g., active users, new sign-ups).
- Navigation options for user management (add, edit, delete) and viewing user activities.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Admins have full access to manage users, including adding, editing, deleting, and viewing activity logs.
- Regular users can only view their profiles and see user statistics.
API Integration

- Mock API integration enables fetching user data and performing CRUD operations.
Data Visualization

- Charts and graphs (powered by Chart.js) visualize user statistics, including user growth over time.
- Responsive Design: The dashboard is fully responsive and optimized for desktop and mobile devices.


## Tech stack

- React.js: Frontend framework used for building user interfaces.
- React Router: For navigation and managing nested routes.
- Chart.js: Data visualization library for displaying user growth statistics.
- Mockapi.io: Mock API library to simulate API responses for CRUD operations.
- CSS Flexbox and Grid: For responsive layout and design.
