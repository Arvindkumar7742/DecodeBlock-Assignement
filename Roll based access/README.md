# Admin Dashboard with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This Admin Dashboard project provides an interface for managing users and their activities. The dashboard includes role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to specific features depending on the userâ€™s role (Admin or User). The application is built with React.js and features data visualization for user statistics, responsive design, and CRUD operations using a mock API.


## Features

#### User Interface

- A main dashboard overview panel displays key user statistics (e.g., active users, new sign-ups).
- Navigation options for user management (add, edit, delete) and viewing user activities.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Admins have full access to manage users, including adding, editing, deleting, and viewing activity logs.
- Regular users can only view their profiles and see user statistics.
API Integration

- Mock API integration enables fetching user data and performing CRUD operations.
Data Visualization

- Charts and graphs (powered by Chart.js) visualize user statistics, including user growth over time.
- Responsive Design: The dashboard is fully responsive and optimized for desktop and mobile devices.


## Tech stack

- React.js: Frontend framework used for building user interfaces.
- React Router: For navigation and managing nested routes.
- Chart.js: Data visualization library for displaying user growth statistics.
- Mockapi.io: Mock API library to simulate API responses for CRUD operations.
- CSS Flexbox and Grid: For responsive layout and design.
